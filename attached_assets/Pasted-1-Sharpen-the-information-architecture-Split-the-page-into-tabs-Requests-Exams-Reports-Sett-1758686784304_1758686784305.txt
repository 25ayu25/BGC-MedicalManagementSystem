1) Sharpen the information architecture

Split the page into tabs (Requests • Exams • Reports • Settings). Keep “New Request” as a persistent primary CTA on the right.

Add a top summary bar with metric cards: Pending Exams, Unpaid, Today’s Slots, Turnaround Time. Each card doubles as a filter.

2) A real filter bar (chips + quick clear)

One horizontal bar under the header: Search (name/ID/phone), Date range, Status (Paid/Unpaid), Exam status (Ordered/Pending/Done).

Applied filters render as chips with ✕ to remove; include “Clear all”.

3) Table that feels premium

Column rethink: Patient (avatar + name + ID) • Age • Contact • Payment • Exam Status • Registered • … (kebab menu).

Status chips only (no raw numbers like “1001”). E.g., Paid, Unpaid, Ordered, Pending, Done. Amounts right-aligned and formatted (“$1,001.00”).

Inline sorting (Registered, Payment), sticky header, row hover, zebra optional, pagination with “Rows per page”.

Bulk select (checkbox in header) for batch actions (Request exam, Mark paid, Export).

Replace the crowded icons with a single … menu per row + tooltips.

4) Slide-over details instead of page jumps

Clicking a row opens a right-hand drawer with full patient context + contextual actions:

Start/Complete Exam

Record Payment

Add Results / Upload

Message patient

Keep the table in view—fast, modern, friendly.

5) Unified status system (design tokens)

Build a tiny StatusBadge that accepts variant: "success|warning|destructive|info|neutral" and icon.

Use tinted backgrounds (e.g., success: bg-emerald-50/ text-emerald-700/ ring-emerald-200) with rounded-full chips. Consistency = polish.

6) Typography, spacing, and elevation

Font: Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans.

Scale: title 22–24, section 18, table 14–15, line-height ≥ 1.45.

Spacing tokens on an 8px grid (8/12/16/24/32). Give cards breathing room (p-6/7), radius-xl/2xl and soft shadow (shadow-sm on cards, shadow on modals).

7) Visual clarity in content

Gender → icon + short label (♀/♂ with tooltip).

Payment → split amount vs status: $1,001 + Unpaid chip, never “1001 Unpaid”.

Services → a mini stepper: Ordered → Pending → Done (with date tooltips). Much clearer than three separate chips.

8) Empty states, skeletons, and micro-interactions

Friendly empty states with icon/illustration + CTA (e.g., “No pending exams — Create request”).

Skeleton rows while loading.

Subtle motion (Framer Motion) for drawer/menus (150–200ms, ease-out). Feels premium.

9) Accessibility & resilience

Touch targets ≥ 44×44px, keyboard focus rings, ARIA labels on icons, WCAG contrast on chips.

Locale-aware currency & date formatting.

Table virtualization if lists get large.

10) Dark mode that actually delights

Use Tailwind’s dark: tokens for chips/cards/shadows; keep neutrals slightly warmer in dark mode for legibility.
