# FINAL Windows Instructions - Guaranteed to Work

## The Problem
You're in the wrong directory. PowerShell is in `C:\Users\Ayu` but your clinic files are in `C:\MedicalTracker`.

## SOLUTION: Navigate to the Right Folder First

**In your PowerShell window, type these commands exactly:**

1. **Navigate to the clinic folder:**
   ```
   cd C:\MedicalTracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the clinic:**
   ```
   npx tsx server/index.ts
   ```

## Step-by-Step What to Type

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Ayu> cd C:\MedicalTracker
PS C:\MedicalTracker> npm install
PS C:\MedicalTracker> npx tsx server/index.ts
```

## What You'll See When It Works

```
âœ“ Database tables initialized
serving on port 5000
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:5000**

## If You Don't Have C:\MedicalTracker

If you haven't extracted the clinic files yet:
1. Download the ZIP file from Replit
2. Extract to `C:\MedicalTracker`
3. Then run the commands above

The key issue was you were trying to run the commands from your home directory instead of the clinic directory where the files actually exist.
